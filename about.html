	Hello there, I am Rebecca. I am a student attending St Helens College. I am currently on the
	<i>Skills for Further Learning and Employment</i> course, and intend on continuing onto the
	<i>IT Level 1</i> course in September of 2022.

	<br><br>

	I have been using Linux since 2012, but have used it primarilly since 2017. I use
	<a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>, with the
	<a href="https://dwm.suckless.org">Suckless dwm</a> tiling window manager. I also primarily use
	terminal based programs, such as Neovim, Neomutt, Newsboat. And apparently most of them begin
	with the letter <b>N</b>.
