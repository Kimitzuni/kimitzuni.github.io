		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>
		Hi there, I am Rebecca, I am currently a student attending St Helens College, on
		the <i>Skills for Further Learning & Employment</i> course. I am intending on
		progressing onto the <i>IT Level 1</i> course in September 2022.<br>
		<br>

		I have been using GNU/Linux for 10 years, but using it primarilly since 2017. I use
		a Lenovo ThinkPad X230 with a classic keyboard from an X220.
		<br><br>

		I use Suckless DWM, and mainly terminal programs, as I find them easier to work
		with. I also run Arch Linux, and run Xorg. People give Arch users a hard time, when
		really it's Wayland users that won't shut up about the stupid software they use.<br>
		<br>

		Jk, its all fun 'n' games yknow.
