			<p><i title="General Kenobi">Hello there!</i> I am Rebecca White, and I am a software developer
			from the United Kingdom, and I have been using Linux since around 2012. I am also a self-taught
			software developer, and I started with the BBC BASIC Programming Language on the BBC Microcomputer
			(Model B), and now I own 3 of these computers. Because I'm cool like that. I also own a ZX Spectrum
			because I'm cool like that. This site serves as my own little playground, and you'll notice that it's
			very simple, very minimal. This is my own choice, because you <b>don't</b> need JavaScript or ads to
			have a site that works.

			<h2>Workflow</h2>
			<p>My workflow is mostly in the terminal, with programs such as Vim (well actually NeoVIM), mutt,
			<i>git</i> and other general terminal programs. I search through code with the <i>vgrep</i> program,
			which is a much better alternative to <i>grep</i>, and I highly recommend it. I have 3 laptops, because
			I like to make things overly awkward I guess. These laptops are:<br>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Lenovo ThinkPad T460s w/ 128GB NVMe, 8GB RAM, Intel i5-6200U
					(<a href="https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadt/thinkpad-t460s/22tp2tt460s">View on Lenovo's Site</a>)

					Lenovo ThinkPad X230 w/ 320GB SSD, 12GB RAM, Intel i5-3200U
					(<a href="https://www.lenovo.com/lt/lt/laptops/thinkpad/x-series/x230/">View on Lenovo's Site</a>)
				</li>

				<li>
					HP Pavilion 15s-eq2510sa w/ 512GB NVMe, 8GB RAM, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U

			Let's start with the T460S. On this I run openSUSE Tumbleweed with the XFCE desktop environment. The desktop environment is just my personal
			preference over the other environments Tumbleweed provides (GNOME and KDE Plasma). The reason for using openSUSE is simply because that's what
			happened to be written on my USB at the time I decided to reinstall Linux.<br><br>

			The X230 has Arch Linux, with the i3 Window Manager and a kind of "minimalist" setup, ie. that it's mostly terminal operated. However I haven't
			updated that system in a while, so it probably is quite outdated, just the nature of running rolling release distributions.<br><br>

			And finally is the HP Pavilion, which is also running the same as the T460S, but with some differences, mainly this has disk encryption, and
			because I have the space to do this on this machine - a separate <code>/home</code> partition, which is roughly 480GB.<br><br>

			My main machine is built from random hardware that I had, and is mostly focused on storage space and quietness. It has 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and Intel
			Core i5-9400F, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 from MSI, a Corsair CX550F RGB PSU, and the motherboard is "MS-7C09" according to <code>neofetch</code>,
			but a readable name for it is the MSI H310M PRO-VDH Plus. In terms of storage, the main boot drive is a 240GB Maxtor Z1 SSD, and for extra
			storage there is a 4TB Seagate BarraCuda drive that I've had for about 3 years, and only recently managed to fill 300GB up. This machine also runs
			openSUSE Tumbleweed with XFCE and has disk encryption.<br><br>

			As for web browsers, because people like to know, I can use any web browser, but my preference is Mozilla Firefox, with (obviously) the extension
			<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">uBlock Origin</a>. Because you would be absolutely insane to not use 
			uBlock<br><br>

			My configuration files are currently not public, however I am working on making them public by removing all things I don't want people to have,
			such as my <code>neomutt</code> configuration having my real email address, SMTP URL etc. When they are ready, they will be uploaded to my
