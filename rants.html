	<h3 id="modern-laptops-are-terrible">Modern Laptops are Terrible</h3>
	<p>
	It's true. All modern laptops <i>are</i> absolutely terrible. Now, I am primarily talking about laptops
	from 2012/2013 onwards. Any laptop that has UEFI as it's default option. While on paper, the hardware <b>is</b>
	better than they were in the 1990s or the early 2000s, before we had 64-bit processors, and processors that
	can get to 5GHz no problem. It's not the hardware I think is terrible. Well it is, but its more the design of the
	laptop.<br><br>

	Now, I use a ThinkPad, more specifically a ThinkPad X230. It's got fairly okay specs for a laptop, i5-3320M @ 3.3GHz
	and 12GB of RAM, which is way more than I need for my use case, but if I need it, I have it. To get into a ThinkPad, it's
	incredibly easy. Roughly 8 screws on the bottom, and then you can pull the keyboard up, and you've got access to the inside.
	(See Reference 1)
	<br><br>

	Now, let's compare this to a laptop from roughly the same year, a laptop I also used to use until the battery broke. An HP
	Pavilion 17-f217ng. It had a fairly good CPU, also an i5 (i5-5200U), and had NVIDIA graphics (GeForce 830M). If you want
	the full spec sheet, you can find it on <a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c04588758">HP's Website</a>. Anyway,
	it was a lot more difficult to open. There were more screws to unscrew, about 15 compared to the 8 of a ThinkPad. But, the most
	annoying thing was prying (yes prying) the keyboard away from the base. Because the keyboard was attached to this big panel which
	also had the mouse, and felt like you were going to break it. (See Reference 2)
	<br><br>

	While it <i>was</i> a "better" laptop, it was more annoying, as it tried to stop the end user making repairs. Which, personally,
	I think that if you're opening a laptop or a PC, you are generally going to know what you're doing.

	</ul>

	Note about Reference 2: While it is a different laptop, the case is the same, and comparing the specs, the only difference
	that I could see was that the 17-f130ng had an AMD Processor, whereas the 17-f217ng had an Intel i5.
