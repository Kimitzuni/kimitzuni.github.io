          <h1>Hardware</h1>
          <p>This page is a sort of 'index' of the hardware I own, for anyone that may be interested in it</p>

          <h2>My "Main" Machine</h2>
          <p>My main machine is my laptop, which is a Lenovo ThinkPad X230 that I bought on eBay for roughly &pound;90. I have modified it so that it has the X220 keyboard and palmrest, as I prefer that style of keyboard, its very nice to type on. In total, costing &pound;60. I also have the ThinkPad UltraBase, which is sort of a dock for your ThinkPad. That cost me about &pound;40</p>

          <h2>Keyboards</h2>
          <p>I have 3 keyboards, my main keyboard is an <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/294640646304">IBM KB-7953 AZERTY PS/2 Keyboard</a>, it's a very nice keyboard, not actually mechanical. Has more of a membrane feel to it. In Linux, the "<code>â‰¶</code>" key is a dead key, and on a UK keyboard, that key is <code>\</code>, so I have had to remap some keys to allow this. Specifically I remapped the "Menu" key (<a href="http://xahlee.info/kbd/i2/menu_key_78f06.jpg">Image of a Menu key</a>). You can find this script on GitHub in my <a href="https://github.com/Kimitzuni/archrice/blob/master/.local/bin/setkb">archrice</a> repository.<br><br>
          
            Another keyboard I have is the "<a href="https://uk.msi.com/Gaming-Gear/VIGOR-GK20">MSI Vigor GK20</a>" keyboard. I haven't got much to say about this. It's a keyboard. It has pretty colours.<br><br>

            The third keyboard is just some generic HP Keyboard that I use if I need a keyboard very quickly.
          </p>

          <h2>Desktops</h2>
          <p>My desktop machine has an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650, 16GB of RAM, an AMD A10-9700 and 10TB of storage, and I use it primarily as a server, or a machine I use for resource intensive tasks<br><br>
