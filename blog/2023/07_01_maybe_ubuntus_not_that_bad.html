			<h2>Maybe, Ubuntu Isn't That Bad</h2>
			<h3 class="blog-date">Saturday, 7th January 2023</h3>
			
			<p>
			In a previous blog post, I complained about Canonical's <i>Ubuntu</i> distribution. However, I think that
			I got some things wrong in that post, and I want to correct some of those things. If you want to read the
			original blog post, you can do - <a href="https://kimitzuni.me/blog/2022/25_12_ubuntu_is_a_bad_distro">Ubuntu
			Is A Bad Distribution</a>.

			<h2 id="ubuntus-flavours">Ubuntu's Flavours</h2>
			<p>In the previous blog post, I focused primarily on <b>Ubuntu</b>. Stock, vanilla plain Ubuntu that you
			can download from <a href="https://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu's Website</a>. GNOME 40. That version. However, there
			are other "flavours" of Ubuntu that have different desktop environments, such as Ubuntu with MATE -
			<a href="https://ubuntu-mate.org/">Ubuntu MATE</a>, or Ubuntu with KDE Plasma -
			<a href="https://kubuntu.org/">Kubuntu</a>. And I highly recommend the Kubuntu distribution, it's one of the
			nicest feeling versions of Ubuntu. I don't know how to explain it, but it feels very nice. But in this post,
			I will be focusing on <a href="https://ubuntuunity.org/">Ubuntu Unity</a>, which is the flavour of Ubuntu
			that uses the old Unity desktop environment from pre-18.04, and I just prefer this desktop over GNOME. So, I
			have this distribution installed on all my machines, except for the Ryzen Laptop, and I have been using it
			for a couple of weeks, and here's what I have to say about this over Ubuntu.
			<br><br>

			It feels much... faster, a lot more responsive, even with Snap packages. The slowness is, sometimes still there
			however it is a lot less prevalent.
			</p>

			<h2 id="steam-on-ubuntu">Steam on Ubuntu</h2>
			<p>Steam on Ubuntu is a lot better than Steam on openSUSE, as it works. I was completely wrong on the performance
			of games on Ubuntu, and specifically my take on running <i>Half-Life 2</i> on Ubuntu being unplayable. This was
			plain wrong. My aim is to not misinform people, and I use the blog as a place to express myself, and talk about
			things I find interesting, but this was outright wrong, and I'm sorry for that. Here is the actual performance of
			Half-Life 2 on Ubuntu: Exactly the same as on Windows. You can play it. It's not laggy at all. There is occasionally
			some lag, but mostly between loading zones, and even then I put that down to - It's loading stuff. Other games, such
			as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/362890/Black_Mesa/">Black Mesa</a>, the Half-Life: Source remake,
			perform equally as well. There is some lagging with that, but it is a more graphics intensive game.</p>

			<h3 id="sou-issues">Issues</h3>
			<p>There are some issues with Steam on Ubuntu, and this mostly has to do with the suspend/sleep function of the
			distribution - Once leaving suspend, the UI of the Steam program just breaks. It's still usable, but broken. I
			have no idea why it does this, but other programs like Chrome also break in the same way.
			</p>

			<h2 id="recommended-ubuntu-distros">Recommended Ubuntu Distros</h2>
			<p>I do recommend some Ubuntu and Ubuntu based distributions, such as
			<a href="https://kubuntu.org">Kubuntu</a> and <a href="https://ubuntuunity.org">Ubuntu Unity</a>, however there is
			another called <a href="https://linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a>, which uses the Cinnamon Desktop Environment and
			provides a more Windows-esque experience.
