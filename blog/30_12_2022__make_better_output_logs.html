                        <p>The fact that most programs on Linux don't have an output log that actually tells you what goes wrong
                            is very frustrating. It would help a lot of people to just have an extra bit of the output tell you what
                            went wrong. This is also more of a rant about Steam on Linux, more than anything else.</p>

			<p>My frustration of this was recently heightened by Valve, and mostly with Steam. While I am a software developer, I do like to play games, recently I've
			been playing through the Half-Life 2 series, and I'm currently on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/420/HalfLife_2_Episode_Two/">HL2 - Episode 2</a>,
			and I wanted to continue that. So, I installed opened Steam... and nothing. I thought, lets try it through the terminal. So that's what I did

			<pre>
                ~ $ steam
                Couldn't import apt, please install python3-apt or update steamdeps for your distribution.
                steam.sh[727]: Running Steam on opensuse-tumbleweed 20221229 64-bit
                steam.sh[727]: STEAM_RUNTIME is enabled automatically
                setup.sh[809]: Steam runtime environment up-to-date!
                steam.sh[727]: Steam client's requirements are satisfied
            </pre>

			And still nothing. No log file that told me what went wrong, and just by looking at this output, you'd think it worked, because it didn't have any obvious
			failures. But Steam still didn't open. So I now had to debug a program that should've been debugged by the multi-billion dollar comapny. So I ran <code>strace</code>
			on Steam.

			And oh dear. That's quite a lot of libraries that just aren't found. Bare in mind that I had managed to open Steam previously, to install the games. But after a 
			restart... It broke. Without telling me why or how. I decided to delete all trace of Steam from my home directory, and reinstall Steam. Steam did start working,
			and on multiple closing and reopenings of it. But this was before I logged in. Though during its update thing, I did load Steam from the <code>$HOME/.steam</code>
			binary, and that decided it would crash.

			<p>But will Steam still load when I restart it? There's only one way to find out. (Side note - I'm also doing this <i>as</i> I write this.) And it did indeed load. However,
			there is still one more test. Will it load after a full restart? And the answer is... Actually yes</p>

			It didn't even work. At all.

			<h2 id="suggestions">Suggestions</h2>
			<p>If you want to make the users of your programs avoid headaches like this, and make it so they don't have to use <code>strace</code> to figure out what is going
			on and why the program just won't work. Add a <code>--debug</code> type flag to your program, that gives just that little bit of extra information. And if you 
			really want to help your users. Make a log file somewhere common.</p>
