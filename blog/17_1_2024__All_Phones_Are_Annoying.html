			<h2>All Phones Are Annoying</h2>
			<p class="blog-info">January, 17th 2024</p>
			<hr>

			<p>
			All phones are designed to be annoying in very oddly specific ways. Sure you can argue and contest
			this by showing the benefits they have had on humans as a whole, but additionally we can also point
			to the disadvantages that they have had, such as people no longer want to be a part of the world
			that is right outside their windows, and would much rather spend hours and hours on TikTok, YouTube,
			Snapchat and Instagram. Which is a shame, because nature is great when you actually are focused on it.
			So, you may be thinking that this is a weird opinion to have right, especially from an 18 year old. Well,
			no not really, not when you actually think about it.
			</p>

			<p>
			On my phones, I don't like the default Samsung firmware, because OneUI is a horrible, bloated mess
			and I also don't trust OneUI and Samsung's firmware. So I choose to install LineageOS on my devices,
			and for devices such as the Samsung Galaxy S7 (<code>herolte</code>), this is fine - as LineageOS builds
			for <code>herolte</code> exist. However, let's switch the tables to a low end Samsung device. Where a 
			LineageOS build <b><i>doesn't</i></b> exist. For example - Samsung Galaxy A12 (<code>a12s</code>). Luckily
			on devices without a build, we can use a Generic System Image (GSI). But wait! A GSI is just the equivalent
			of the <code>system.img</code> file. Samsung's modern firmwares use <code>super.img</code>, which combines
			several of the images into one, so we can't just flash a <code>system.img</code> file anymore, we instead
			have to unpack the <code>super.img</code> and repack it with our new <code>system.img</code> in there. Easy?
			<br><br>
	
			But wait! There's more! Samsung Knox. Samsung Knox is one of the most infurating things I have ever had
			to deal with. Knox <b>claims</b> to make your device safer, however &mdash; I disagree. It is only there to
			make your life more difficult if you ever decide to actually do something with your phone. It will fight
			you <b>every. single. step of the way.</b> Knox has a security check to see if your phone has been modified,
			and if it has, it does a few things. 1 - it voids your warranty so good luck with that. 2 - you can no longer
			use certain features of your phone, such as contactless payment. Samsung, you need to understand this:
			<b>if I am unlocking the bootloader &mdash; I know what I'm doing. Stop trying to fight your users.</b>
			It makes you look like Apple.

			<br>
			<br>

			Ironically, the easiest phones to de-Google and install a custom ROM onto are the Google Pixel phones.<br><br>

			People are probably going to suggest something like "well get a Google Pixel", "Buy an iPhone!", "buy a Microsoft
			phone, I have lots of apps I swear". And, I don't want to. Because it just takes a cursory glance at the market
			to understand that phone design and features have peaked a long time ago.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Google</b> &mdash; They release a new Pixel phone like every 6 months or something, so the previous model
					never gets a chance to fall in price, and they're all in on AI, so the phones are expensive;</li><br>

				<li><b>Samsung</b> &mdash; Their phones will fight you every step of the way if they can. Low and mid range
					Samsung Galaxy devices are awful, and the good phones are the Galaxy S and Z phones which are quite
					often in the range of Â£1000+;</li><br>

				<li><b>Huawei</b> &mdash; Essentially just copying the phone designs of Samsung;</li>
				<li><b>Nokia</b> &mdash; Low budget Android devices, as Windows Mobile was a massive flop;</li>
				<li><b>Research In Motion - BlackBerry</b> &mdash; Rest In Peace;</li>
				<li><b>Apple</b> &mdash; No.</li>
			</ul>
		
			<p>
			The mobile phone market also finds itself in the unique situation of everyone wanting to innovate, but everyone
			is copying each other so no actual innovation is getting done. The last big things in phone design were the Galaxy
			Note's pen, biometric unlocking, the removal of physical home buttons, the removal of the headphone jack and making the
			front-facing camera part of the screen.
			</p>

			<p>
			Phones are especially annoying  nowadays if you want to repair it yourself. Even if you just need a new battery, replacing
			it yourself is near impossible. Let's go back just 12 years to the Galaxy S3. That had a removable back cover and removable
			battery. If your battery started to degrade and not hold as much charge, you simply bought a new one online (or in person,
			we hadn't yet become that degenerate), and you simply took the old one out and put the new one in. A very simple process. But
			now, you either have to be confident enough to use a heat gun on the back of a phone near the battery, or take it to someone
			who is - and that isn't cheap either.<br><br>

			I believe that this stems from the iPhone, as since the beginning of the iPhone in 2007,
			Apple never wanted you going inside of it. In at least iPhone 4 - SE, you could take the screen out yourself (I don't know if
			it was like this on any other models), but fundamentally you still had to know what type of screwdriver you needed, as it
			wasn't a standard <code>+</code> or <code>-</code> screw. That would be way too easy.
			</p>

			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>
			Every phone is basically the same. Blame everyone.
